A collection of matrix operations based on the arma::matrix library.

The Armadillo library is located at:
http://arma.sourceforge.net/

The CxdMath library provides some simple "Matrix" operations.
The intention is to combine these operations into larger units of work, currently the library has only one example of this being the McCullochPittsNeuralNetwork.
Currently I am using this library in a cocoa project to experiment with this simple neural network.
Other neural network implementations are intended in the future when I get some more time to play.

The CxdNNTrainer provides a user interface that can be used to train the neural net. 
This UI uses the CorePlot framework to plot the error curve CorePlot is available from http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/
